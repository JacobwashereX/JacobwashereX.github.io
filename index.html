<h1>My Sun, My Moon, My Heart, My Soul</h1>
<h2>Amy Renee Brown</h2>
<h3>(soon to be Miller)</h3>
<p> The day I was surprised with a note after school was the day I met my soulmate. That was the day my life changed forever. Thats the day I will never forget. That was the day I met her, Amy Brown. The most beautiful, smart, nice, amazing, perfect girl in the world. She is the best girlfriend in the world and I could never ask for anyone better because no one is. I love her with all my heart and nothing will change that. I never want anybody but her. She makes me the happiest man in the world and I never wanna lose her.This has been the most amazing time of my life and theres no one else that i'd ever want to spend the rest of my life with. The thing I want most in life is to spend eternity with her.</p>
